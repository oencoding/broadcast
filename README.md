# Broadcast
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/omarqazi/broadcast.svg?branch=production)](https://travis-ci.org/omarqazi/broadcast)

Broadcast is a simple HTTP live streaming server in Go. It serves media files off the local filesystem, and automatically generates playlists of media files to coordinate the live broadcast.

## Project Goals
I'm developing this server to power a live broadcast, and will add whatever capabilities I need. Feel free to reuse any code that helps, or send a pull request.
